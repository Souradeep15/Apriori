# Apriori
1)	I have used pycharm (a tool by JetBrains for python). It has a GUI and compiler so I didnâ€™t have to compile my file in the terminal.
2)	But we can compile it through terminal too. You just need to install a package called pandas (you can use pip install pandas for that).
3)	After that you need to create a file containing all the data and go to the directory.
4)	Then, we can compile it using command >python Apriori.py as shown below
